# Topics in Data Science with Python and Spark

This is a repository collecting IPython/Jupyter notebooks originally
developed for the course [ESC403 "Introduction to Data Science" at
UZH][1] in the spring semesters 2014-2017.  Notebooks were developed
and run on a Spark/Hadoop cluster (+ Jupyter and Anaconda Python)
installed with [ElastiCluster][2]

All notebooks with solutions are collected in the `notebooks/`
directory; the `exercises/` directory contains the same notebooks with
solutions and commentory removed, so that they can be handed out to
students as assignments.
