This directory will be populated with Jupyter notebooks of the exercises
sessions as the course progresses.

Notebook files will be pushed to the main ESC403 repo
(http://github.com/esc403/esc403); in order to have them appear in forked
repositories too, you will need to periodically merge the main repo into yours::

    # assuming that the `upstream` remote points to https://github.com/esc403/esc403
    git merge upstream
